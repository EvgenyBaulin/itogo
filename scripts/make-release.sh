# Builds a release of the Direct build, packages it, signs the package with the owner's
# Sparkle key and writes the entry that announces it.

# What this script will not do, ever: make a key, or put one in the repository. The private
# key lives in the owner's keychain, the public key is passed in, and the tool that signs is
# Sparkle's own.

#   SPARKLE_PUBLIC_KEY   the EdDSA public key that goes into Info.plist; without it, or with
#                        the placeholder, the release stops. A file `sparkle-public-key.txt`
#                        in the repository root is read when the variable is not set; it is
#                        ignored by git.
#   SPARKLE_BIN          directory holding Sparkle's `sign_update`; found among the packages
#                        Xcode fetched when not given.
#   ITOGO_BUILD_ROOT     the build root, as `make release-local` passes its BUILD_ROOT; when
#                        not set, the real path the `Build.nosync` link points to.
