#!/bin/bash
# Fails when CI runs less than `make verify` does. CI vouches for what one Mac cannot show
# alone (a clean store bundle, a native app, glass only where it belongs), and a check that
# `make verify` has and the workflow does not passes every
# pull request unseen: on 24.09 the workflow ran two checks of fourteen and built the App Store
# configuration without once looking inside it.
#
# Every prerequisite of `verify` must be reached by a `make` the workflow runs, directly or
# through a target whose prerequisites include it. Left out on purpose: `fmt`, which rewrites
# files instead of judging them; `lint`, advisory in style, which
# the Makefile runs within `ci-checks` for the one rule it enforces; and `check-toolchain`, which
# `test-core` asks for itself.
#
# And every job of every workflow has a limit of its own (`timeout-minutes`), and every
# `xcodebuild … test` gives each test one: without them a test that hangs holds a runner for
# GitHub's default six hours and never says which test it was. `make test` carries the limits
# of a test by itself, and so must every target of the
# Makefile that runs `xcodebuild … test` — `make test-ui` too, which ran with none: a UI test
# stuck on a system prompt held the run until the alarm of the whole of it, half an hour later,
# and named no test.
#
# And every secret a workflow reads is named as a secret in the instructions a maintainer
# follows — the section «Выпуск» of README.md: a release once stopped on SPARKLE_PUBLIC_KEY
# while the instructions of the day asked for SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY alone. A name counts where a
# list item or a paragraph that says «секрет» or «secret» spells it; a variable of the same name
# elsewhere does not.
#
# And every job on macOS that runs the tests of AppCore hands them a Python with pandas
# (`ITOGO_PYTHON=` on the line of the command, as build.yml does): without it the suite that
# reads every Reports table back with `pandas.read_csv` is skipped and the job still ends green.
# The Linux job is left out: one reading on macOS keeps the promise.
#
# And every job that generates the project — `xcodegen`, or `make`, whose targets generate it —
# installs XcodeGen through scripts/install-xcodegen.sh, one release built from a source checked
# against its checksum; never with `brew install`, which takes whatever the day's formula is, so
# the project CI builds could change without a line of this repository changing.
#
# And every action a workflow uses is at a major that runs on Node 24. The runners of 21.09 ran
# checkout@v4 and setup-python@v5, both declared for Node 20, on Node 24 already and said in every
# log that Node 20 is going (github.blog, 2025-09-19); the next step is a failure. An action the
# table below does not know fails too, so a new one is added with its first Node 24 major.
#
# And every step a workflow names in an expression (`steps.<id>.outcome`, `steps.<id>.outputs…`)
# is declared by an `id:` in the same job. A step GitHub cannot find reads as an empty outcome:
# `if: steps.prepared.outcome == 'success'` over a renamed id is false, the steps it guards are
# skipped, and a skipped step does not fail the job — the run ends green without building or
# testing anything.
#
# Usage: check-ci.sh [<Makefile> <workflow.yml>]   (default: Makefile, .github/workflows/build.yml;
#                                                  the limits, pandas, XcodeGen, the actions,
#                                                  the step ids and the secrets are checked in
#                                                  every workflow)
