# Writes the <item> that announces a release in the update feed, and refuses to print one that
# the feed could not carry: the entry is put into the envelope of the feed
# (scripts/appcast-envelope.xml) and read back with xmllint before a line of it is printed. A
# feed that does not parse is not one bad entry — Sparkle drops the whole document, and no
# installed copy ever sees an update again.
#
# Usage: release-entry.sh <version> <build> <length> <signature> [<date>]
#        release-entry.sh into <appcast.xml> <version> <build> <length> <signature> [<date>]
#                   puts the entry into that feed, newest first, and refuses a build number the
#                   feed already announces, or one below
#   version    MARKETING_VERSION, X.Y.Z
#   build      CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION, a whole number
#   length     the size of the archive in bytes
#   signature  the EdDSA signature of the archive alone: what `sign_update -p` prints. Without
#              `-p` the tool prints `sparkle:edSignature="…" length="…"`, and a length written
#              twice on one element is a document no XML parser reads (the length is ours).
#   date       RFC 822 date of the entry; now, when not given
#        release-entry.sh --self-test
