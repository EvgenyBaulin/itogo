#!/bin/bash
# The version of a release, read in one place and checked in the places it ends up. Used by
# make-release.sh and by .github/workflows/release.yml alike.
#
# The rule: CFBundleShortVersionString comes from the tag,
# CFBundleVersion grows with every release. The version lives in project.yml,
# so a tag has to say what project.yml says, and the app that was built
# has to say it too. Sparkle compares CFBundleVersion only: an archive named 1.0.1 that holds an
# app saying 1.0.0 (1) is either never offered or offered again after every install.
#
# Usage: release-version.sh version [<project.yml>]     prints MARKETING_VERSION
#        release-version.sh build [<project.yml>]       prints CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION
#        release-version.sh tag <tag> [<project.yml>]   fails unless the tag is v<MARKETING_VERSION>
#        release-version.sh app <Itogo.app> <version> <build>
#                                                       fails unless the built app says both
#        release-version.sh grew [<repository>]         fails unless CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION is
#                                                       greater than at the release before and
