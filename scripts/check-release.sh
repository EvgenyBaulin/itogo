# Looks at a published release from the outside, the way an installed copy meets it: the feed at
# the address every copy asks, the archive the feed points at, and the app inside that archive.
# Run it after a release is out; it writes nothing but a temporary folder it removes.
#
# What it refuses:
#   * a feed that does not parse, or whose entries are not newest first with a build number
#     each greater than the one below it (Sparkle offers the greatest build; two entries with
#     one build are one release announced twice);
#   * an entry whose archive address is not the release of its own version;
#   * an archive of another size than the feed says, or whose EdDSA signature does not hold for
#     the public key of the repository — Sparkle refuses such an update on every Mac, silently;
#   * an app inside that is not io.github.EvgenyBaulin.itogo, says another version or build,
#     carries another key or feed address, asks for another macOS than the feed says, has a
#     broken signature, has no installer service of Sparkle or services of its own, or carries
#     another Sparkle than project.yml pins;
#   * an app not signed by the owner's certificate «Itogo Local Signing» — an ad-hoc signature
#     verifies all the same, and make-release.sh only warns without the certificate;
#   * an app that does not satisfy the designated requirement of the app of the entry below it:
#     macOS keys the sandbox container and the keychain items of an installed copy to its
#     signature, and Sparkle, whose EdDSA check a new signer passes, would install a stranger.
#
# The feed comes through the cache of Pages: minutes after a push to gh-pages the address may
# still serve the feed before it. A version the address does not announce and the branch
# origin/gh-pages does is said to be that.
#
# Usage: check-release.sh [<version>]   the entry of that version; the newest when not given

#                                       and feed, the owner's certificate, the Sparkle pinned,
