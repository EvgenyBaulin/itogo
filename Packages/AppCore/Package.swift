// AppCore: pure Swift + Foundation only. It must build on macOS, Linux and, later, Windows.
// No AppKit, SwiftUI, GRDB, Charts, CryptoKit or Sparkle may ever appear here.
//
// The code is split into focused targets. `CoreKit` holds the shared value types and
// contracts; every other target builds on it and nothing else, so the targets can be
// developed and compiled independently. The one exception is `CoreAnalytics`: the numbers
// of Overview, Analytics and Reports must follow the accounting rules exactly, so it builds
// on `CoreAccounting` (and on `CoreCSV` for the report export) instead of copying them.
// `AppCore` is the umbrella the app imports.
