///   expense or a refund, an income one for income. A category archived since it was

///   contributions, debt payments, money given back and parts in system categories are
///   left alone; system categories are never a target either.
/// * **Re-filing** — the same change of category, made only to the parts filed under the
///   categories named: the other parts of a split stay as they were, their source included.
/// * **Quality** — becomes mine (`manual`). Goal contributions stay good; income and money
///   given back have no quality.
/// * **For whom** — a group drops the person; a person keeps the group unless it was «me»,
///   which becomes «other». Parts paid for somebody else already name who owes them, and
///   money given back has no «для кого».
/// * **Event** — every kind of operation takes one.
/// * **Place** and **payment method** are fields of the operation. Income gets no place.
