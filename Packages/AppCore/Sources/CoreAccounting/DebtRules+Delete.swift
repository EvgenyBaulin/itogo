/// keeps pointing at it. That is what keeps the figures right: a payment on a purchase made on
/// credit is not spending only while it names its debt, a purchase on credit moves no money on
/// the account only while it does, and the money the journal alone lent or borrowed stays in the
/// balances of the accounts.
