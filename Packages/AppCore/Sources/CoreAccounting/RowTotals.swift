/// What a set of operations comes to: one day of the list, the operations selected in it,
/// the text of the dialog that deletes them. One function for all three, so the
/// header of a day, the bar under that day selected whole and the confirmation that deletes
/// it can never disagree.
///
/// Four sums, all in rubles, deleted operations left out:
///
/// * `myExpenses` — `MyExpensesRule.contribution` of every part: a refund goes in with a
///   minus, a part paid for somebody else stays out until it is written off, a payment on
///   something bought in instalments stays out altogether. A refund taken back from a purchase
///   counts in the purchase instead (`RefundIndex`): the purchase comes in cheaper, and the
///   refund itself adds nothing — so a day, a selection and the Overview agree;
/// * `income` — operations of kind `income`, a surplus in Surcharges among them;
/// * `forOthers` — parts of purchases paid for somebody else that were not written off:
///   money I laid out that is not my spending;
/// * `moneyReturned` — reimbursements, the money people gave back. It is neither income nor
///   spending, so it is kept apart and never added to either.
