/// The money that has to leave the accounts in the summary from today through a day D, in
/// rubles at today's rates: what the grey line of the free sum takes from what can be spent now
/// (`FreeMoney`). Money, not spending: a payment for somebody else counts in full — it leaves
/// the account whoever gives it back later.
///
/// * **Scheduled** — every unpaid due date `d` of every active scheduled payment with
///   `next_date ≤ d ≤ D`, one-off ones included and overdue ones of any month too, at the price
///   on `d`, in full: a due date nothing paid is money that has not left yet, whatever the
///   counts of the account say — the owner closes one the bank took before a count with «Уже
///   списано до сверки». A due date paid by a link or by a matching ordinary operation
///   (`ScheduledMatches`) is not due. The money is the payment's account's — the main one when
///   it names none or names an archived one (`DueAccounts.effective`); payments on an account
///   of a group left out of the summary are left out with its money. A due of a payment tied
///   to an event, dated by the event's end, is part of that event's budget while the event is
///   counted (below), not a line of its own.
/// * **Debts** — for every open debt I owe with a monthly payment, a payment day and something
///   left on it: every unpaid monthly due through D (`DebtDueState.unpaid`, the money paid
///   closing the earliest dues), overdue ones of earlier months included, less what was paid
///   toward the first of them, never more in all than the debt's balance, in the debt's
///   currency. The money is that of the account of the
///   debt's last payment (`DebtAccount.lastPayment`, through `DueAccounts.effective`); a debt
///   paid from an account of a group left out of the summary is left out with its money.
/// * **Goal savings** — with `subtractGoalSavings` (the setting «Деньги целей лежат на счетах в
///   сводке», on by default): what is saved in every live goal, at today's rate or at the
///   rubles its contributions cost (`GoalSavingsValuation`). That money is on the accounts but
///   is not free: `FreeMoney` takes it off the money now, so «можно тратить сейчас» leaves it
///   out and a contribution changes neither figure. It is not a line of the grey formula.
/// * **Goal plans** — with `reserveGoalPlan`: for every live goal with a monthly plan, what is
///   left of this month's plan (`GoalPlanState.restThisMonth`) plus a full plan for every later
///   month whose 1st is by D, less what went in above the plans (`creditOut`), never more than
///   the goal still needs.
/// * **Events** — with `reserveEventBudgets` (on by default): every live event with a budget that
///   is under way today or starts after today and by D: max(what is left of its budget, its
///   unpaid tied dues) — the rest of the budget is budget − spent by today (what is written for
///   later days is still to leave the accounts) − what matching operations without the event
///   paid of its tied payments. Off, no budget is held back and the dues tied to an event are
///   ordinary dues.
