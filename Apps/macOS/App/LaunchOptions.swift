/// What the app was launched with, for the checks and the measurements of the build.
/// An owner who opens the app from the Dock passes none of these.
///
/// * `--data-set <sample|sample-large|bench|ui-test>` — a folder of its own for synthetic
///   data (`AppPaths.DataSet`); the Debug and Release databases are never touched.
/// * `--generate <months|large>`, and the older `--generate-sample` for six months — Debug
///   only: the set's folder is made anew and filled with a generated history before the
///   app opens it. Without `--data-set` the set is `sample`, or `sample-large` for `large`.
/// * `--generate-only` — Debug only: quit once the set is written (`make bench-app`).
/// * `--slow-pipeline` — Debug only: every step of the pipeline takes three seconds from the
///   run of the launch on, as Debug → Pipeline → «Slow down» makes it for ⌘R, so the
///   placeholders of the start can be seen (`make sample ARGS=--slow-pipeline`).
/// * `--open transactions,analytics,reports` — open these windows at launch;
///   `--analytics-section <id>` and `--analytics-period <month|year|12m>` choose what the
///   Analytics window shows, and only on a data set: the set keeps them under keys of its
///   own (`AnalyticsWindow.storageKey`), because the Debug build and the Release of
///   `make bench-app` share one domain of defaults — the Debug id — and the build's own
///   window is not the set's. They open windows and choose, never write data, and never
///   touch what the window outside the set shows. Outside Debug they are taken only together
///   with `--measure`, the measurement they serve.
/// * `--measure` — the Analytics window times every change (`AnalyticsMeasurement`);
///   `--measure-runs <n>` makes n changes by itself and quits (`make bench-app`).
/// * `--no-reminders` — Debug only: the sheet of the day's reminders stays away, so a UI test
///   clicks in the window rather than in a sheet over it.
/// * `--present period-chooser,inspector` — Debug only: shows by itself, three seconds after
///   its window appears, what otherwise takes a click — the period chooser of Analytics and
///   Reports, the inspector of Transactions on the newest operation (with `selection`, that
///   operation selected too, as after a double click), the card of the first debt (`debt`). The checks of the build
///   have no permission to click; this is how the crash of 19.09, a view shown in a host of
///   its own without the app's environment, is reproduced.
///
/// AppKit reads the arguments as `-key value` pairs: a flag without a value followed by
/// another flag takes it as its value, and the word after that is left without a key. AppKit
/// used to open such a word as a document, and a launch that opens a document makes no
/// window, so nothing started at all (found by `make bench-app`: `--measure --data-set bench`
/// opened the app without a window). The app now registers `NSTreatUnknownArgumentsAsOpen =
/// NO` (`ItogoApp.init`); the recipes still put flags without a value last.
