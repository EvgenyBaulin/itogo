/// What was written at a moment is in the balances of that very moment, whatever the clock
/// says. A database that keeps its moments later than they happened — rounded to the
/// millisecond, or taken to the microsecond first — makes a balance worked out right after the
/// write miss it: a transfer that moved nothing, an operation that spent nothing, a count that
/// was not there yet. The clocks tried:
///
/// * 14:13:20.9995 UTC — half a millisecond before the next one begins, where rounding keeps
///   14:13:21.000;
/// * 14:13:20.123 counted in seconds since 1970 — a hair below the instant the database reads
///   `.123` as, where taking the microsecond first keeps `.123`, later than the moment;
/// * the last `Date` before 14:13:20.002 — the same, a tenth of a microsecond before a
///   millisecond, as the clock gives one;
/// * 14:13:20 — a whole second, which every rule keeps.
