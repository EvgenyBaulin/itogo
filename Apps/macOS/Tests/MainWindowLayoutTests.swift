/// The entry bar is the reason this file exists. It floats over the list, and the list has to
/// keep its last rows clear of it — but the room it needs must come from the safe area, not
/// from a height the bar measures and hands back. The second promise is the one that is easy
/// to break while keeping the first: the ↓ panel and the caption come and go while somebody
/// is typing, and the list must not jump every time they do. Only the capsule, the chips and
/// the selection bar count.

/// Some of these tests take the app's activity away and give it back, as
/// `TransactionsLayoutTests` does; the focus blinks for a moment while they run.
