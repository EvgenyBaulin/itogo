/// "Money back from a person": pick the person, pick the parts that are waiting and enter
/// what came back. The rules live in `CoreAccounting` — an excess becomes income in
/// Surcharges, a shortfall becomes my spending in the category of the original part, and
/// the reimbursement itself is never income.
///
/// The money may come in any currency, onto any account: «Валюта», «На счёт» and, for money not
/// in rubles, «Курс возврата». The distribution and what each part is owed are in rubles — the
/// money's rubles at its rate. An account that holds neither the money's currency nor rubles
/// asks what it was credited («Зачислено на счёт»); one whose main currency is rubles gets the
/// money's rubles. A bank rate that is only a guess — the day not published yet — is never
/// written as the bank's: the rate has to be typed. A part paid in another currency shows its own amount with the
/// rubles next to it; its purchase's rate can be corrected from the statement («Курс покупки»),
/// and the purchase is then written at it in the same write. One whose rate is still
/// provisional waits for the pipeline, unless its rate is typed.
///
/// Opened from the entry line, it starts from what was typed there (`prefill`): the money
/// that came back stays as typed while parts are ticked, and `recorded` tells the line the
/// reimbursement went in.
