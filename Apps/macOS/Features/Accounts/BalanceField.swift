/// Empty is «не знаю» (`nil`), never zero: an account nobody counted stays uncounted, and its
/// first count becomes its starting point. A 0 typed is a count of zero and shows «0». A minus
/// is money owed — a credit card counted at −30,000 — and «-» or «−» both read. The text is an
/// amount or an expression, as in any amount field; it stays as typed while the owner types
/// and is written back the one way the app writes amounts once he is done (Enter, Tab, leaving
/// the field). Text that does not read yet leaves the balance as it was.
