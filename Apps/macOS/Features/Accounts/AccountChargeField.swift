/// Prefilled from the bank's rates (through rubles for two foreign currencies) and editable:

/// charged in the same currency — once the amount, currency, day or account it was typed for
/// changes, it says it was not worked out again. A prefill resting on a rate the bank has not

/// says to check the statement. An empty field means no rate was found: the figure has to be
